# Python_Project2_RD
This is a rough draft of my python project 2 upload for BIMM 143 SP22

Uploaded Files:

humanp53_DNA_binding_structure (1).pdb contains the .pdb information for 3D structure generation of human p53 using NGLview

humanp53_nucleotide_DNAbinding.fasta contains the nucleotide sequences of the human p53 DNA binding domain necessary for a pairwise sequence alignment using biopython pairwise2

loxodontap53_DNAbinding_structure (1).pdb contains the .pdb info for 3d structure generation of the DNA binding domain of African Elephant p53 using NGLview

loxodontap53_nucleotide_DNAbinding.fasta contains the nucleotide sequences of the African Elephant p53 DNA binding domain necessary for a pairwise sequence alignment using biopython pairwise2

proteins(1).txt contains the amino acid sequences of human and loxodonta DNA binding region of p53. This file is used to generate a sequence logo in logomaker

Scientific Question: How do the functional domains of elephant p53 compare to the functional domains of human p53?

Scientific Hypothesis: If elephants have lower rates of cancer than humans, then their p53 protein has more functional domains than human p53.
